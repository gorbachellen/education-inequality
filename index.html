                    <p class="lead">
                        Through our final project, we hope to map the disparities between education opportunities within
                        the United States. Inspired by author, Jonathan Kozol’s work Savage Inequalities: Children in
                        America's Schools, we understand that there are differences in fundings for neighborhoods with
                        residents with higher income versus residents with lower income. This contrast led to a huge gap
                        in the quality of education in public schools. The essential resources such as infrastructures,
                        good teachers, or living environments were not equally shared among these public schools when
                        they should have been as they are key factors necessary to equip a child with knowledge and
                        quality assistance. Our team’s goal is to produce a timeline of the average funding each student
                        from each state received from 1993 to 2016 to show how situations were improved or worsened with
                        spatial patterns. Also, we will also show the average reading and mathematical scores of each
                        state along with race and population factors within each period of time.

                        Demonstrating how living in one location in one’s childhood will impact his or her entire life
                        due to the financial status or the funding from local government to the public school system is
                        the vital factor that highlights the significance of our project. However, our project is not
                        intended to point fingers and create a person or entity to blame. Rather, we want to show the
                        milestones of improvements in each area with our map and give potential advice on the
                        reallocation of public school resources from the federal government.

                        schools through a collection of choropleth maps dated 2005 to 2015. The map data is filtered by
                        the categories of “Money on Students”, “Enrollment”, “Instruction Expenditure”, and “Federal
                        Revenue”. By displaying the progress (or lack thereof) of schools over time, we begin to paint a
                        picture of how school is valued through the lens of money. How much is spent? Where? This leads
                        us to the Map of Academic Achievement, where we delve into academic performance by state.</p>

                        ask ourselves are: Where are the best scores? Where are the worst?
