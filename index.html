                        Through our final project, we hope to map the disparities between education opportunities within
                        the United States. Inspired by author, Jonathan Kozol’s work Savage Inequalities: Children in
                        America's Schools, we understand that there are differences in fundings for neighborhoods with
                        residents with higher income versus residents with lower income. This contrast led to a huge gap
                        in the quality of education in public schools. The essential resources such as infrastructures,
                        good teachers, or living environments were not equally shared among these public schools when
                        they should have been as they are key factors necessary to equip a child with knowledge and
                        quality assistance. Our team’s goal is to produce a timeline of the average funding each student
                        from each state received from 1993 to 2016 to show how situations were improved or worsened with
                        spatial patterns. Also, we will also show the average reading and mathematical scores of each
                        state along with race and population factors within each period of time.

                        Demonstrating how living in one location in one’s childhood will impact his or her entire life
                        due to the financial status or the funding from local government to the public school system is
                        the vital factor that highlights the significance of our project. However, our project is not
                        intended to point fingers and create a person or entity to blame. Rather, we want to show the
                        milestones of improvements in each area with our map and give potential advice on the
                        reallocation of public school resources from the federal government.

                        the categories of “Money on Students”, “Enrollment”, “Instruction Expenditure”, and “Federal
                        Revenue”. By displaying the progress (or lack thereof) of schools over time, we begin to paint a
                        picture of how school is valued through the lens of money. How much is spent? Where? This leads
                        us to the Map of Academic Achievement, where we delve into academic performance by state.</p>

                        revenue and instruction expedeniture, the money put on each students was higher in the northern
                        states. Even the charts of median values show a constant growth on the money, the funds used on
                        students from different states demonstrate that growth is limited in many states. In 2015, the
                        last year of the data, there's still a 4 dollars to 16 dollars range

                        We examined 2 different markers of academic achievement: GPA and SAT scores. Through the years,
                        we see slow but linear growth in average GPA in both language arts fields (social
                        science/history, art/music, english, and foreign languages) and STEM fields (natural science
                        and math). This sign of improvement in the U.S. education system is wonderful, however, given the
                        lack of standardization in how GPA is assigned across individual schools, let alone the entire 
                        nation, means that looking at a standardization method of achievement is needed in conjunction
                        with GPA. When looking at SAT scores over the years, we don't see as clear of a pattern. 2005
                        marks the beginning of <a href="https://www.petersons.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-how-it-changes/"
                        > a new SAT: </a> added writing section, possible score boost to 2400, and total test time of 
                        3 hours and 45 minutes with no breaks. This test remains the same throughout our entire research
                        period of 2005-2015, and yet interestingly, the percentage of people getting in the lower half of 
                        possible scores both on the verbal portion (now known as the Critical Reading portion) and the math 
                        portion was never as low as it was in 2005. Specifically looking at students who get these lower
                        scores allows us to examine the performance of students at a more even level, since students in 
                        who score in the higher categories may be influenced by private tutors, aka factors that don't 
                        reflect on the quality of the education system in America. Even with this taken into account, there
                        doesn't seem to be a too large of a direct connection between money spent on students and academic
                        achievement (look at Wyoming vs New York), meaning that the education system in America isn't 
                        effective at preparing students in the metrics we examined.

                        processing, Mapbox and D3 js helped us
                        create the thematical maps and the data charts. And we used bootstrap for creating the index and

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">We recognize the inherent biases of SAT scores as a reflection of education level.
                        Students of a lower family income level tend to score lowest, whereas students of a higher
                        family income level have much higher average scores. Disadvantage can mostly be attributed to
                        test preparation, but may also have something to do with “stereotype threat”, where “reminding
                        students of their racial group before taking a test can impact their score” (Elsesser, 2019).
                        Additionally, at this point in time, points were deducted for incorrect answers. With this in
                        mind, students took different approaches than others when it came to the exam that could affect
                        performance. Therefore, while our data is sound, SAT scores themselves are not always reflective
                        of a population and how they otherwise perform academically.</p>
